                  <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>

                  <p>Thankfully I had a boss who was compassionate and I gained a lot of respect for him as a result and therefore wanted to create work for him in return. Many situations would arise to which he would have to solve, and on multiple occasions they were conflicts and miscommunications between people. I felt that this leader was good at judging the situation based on the circumstances of each person and not on their assumed behavior or percieved character. I feel this helped to keep his mind objective and therefore get to the truth more compassionately and effeciently. I learned a lot from these interactions and quickly realised how effective social skills and emotional intelligence can be and how beneficial it can be to productivity.</p>

                  <p>I liked this quote from "Search Inside Yourself" by Chade-Meng Tan;
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “This shift is the transformation from “I” to “We.” It is the most important process leaders go through in becoming authentic. How else can they unleash the power of their organizations unless they motivate people to reach their full potential? If our supporters are merely following our lead, then their efforts are limited to our vision and our directions.... Only when leaders stop focusing on their personal ego needs are they able to develop other leaders.”</p>
                  
                  <h5>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5>

                  <p>I had a go at this, again, depending on how well my mind accepted the exercise, reflected on its results. I found that I could imagine all the visuals suggested by the exercise, and from this imagination came the feelings that were associated with them. Feelings such as giving goodness to the world, expanding myself etc were all nice feelings but my mind was slightly accelerated because of the days work and therefore I found it sometimes hard to focus on certain thoughts over others. I have an open mind and it was fun to do for a while. All in all I felt better.</p>

                  <h5>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5>

                  <p>This exercise was a little more serious as the author suggested. Instead of imagining goodness and positive thoughts, there is a time where you are asked to take on the suffering of others. Obviously this does bring about 'negative' feelings that are somewhat heavier than the positive ones. I felt again that my mind was running while doing this exercise and that my mind 'assumed' what it was supposed to feel without it really immersing itself into the exercise. I liked the idea that it is kind of like a recycling process and kind of like the role of a tree—sucking in the bad, releasing out the good.</p>

                  <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>

                  <p>My status and autonomy were most affected in Phase 0. I had fun doing these assignments, but being pretty much late by a week—every week—was a shot at my ego and self-confidence. I didn't get too down about it though because I wanted to perservere and get through with it. I was also excited to meet everybody as I like to be in the environment—it helps me learn better. My autonomy was also affected in that it did take time for me get onto my assignments; usually in the last remaining days of the week (this week included). Stress levels ran quite high at some points because I was trying to balance not being too late but also soaking in the information and not rushing the assignments either. I ended up prioritising knowledge over timing so although I was later than usual, at least I tried my best to soak in the knowledge.</p>

                  <h5>Any other musings?</h5>

                  <p>Here are some more notes that I found helpful from chapter 8:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “Based on the insight above, here is a four-step plan for expanding the magnitude and reach of your influence.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  1. Know that you already have influence. You already affect people. It is a simple matter of improving what you can already do.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  2. Strengthen self-confidence. The more you are aware of and comfortable with your own strengths and weaknesses, the more confident you become and the more effectively you can influence people. Emotionally, people gravitate toward confidence, especially the type of self-confidence based on kindness and authenticity. The mindfulness practices in Chapters 2 and 3 and the self-awareness practices in Chapter 4 will help you with self-confidence.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  3. Understand people and help them succeed. You can influence people more effectively if you understand them and try to help them achieve their goals in ways that also help you achieve yours. The empathy practices in Chapter 7 plus the compassion practices earlier in this chapter will help you with understanding and helping people. Your knowledge of the neuroscience of the social brain learned from the last section will also help you greatly.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  4. Serve the greater good. While remembering to take care of your own self-interest, never forget to go beyond just serving self-interest. Act also for the good of the team, or the good of the company, or the good of the world. Inspire the same in others. When your goodness inspires others, you can influence them more effectively. The practices in Chapter 6 on motivation, and the compassion practices in this[…]”</p> 

                  <p>“Love them. Understand them. Forgive them. Grow with them.”</p>

                  <p>“These five domains form a model which David calls the SCARF model, which stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness.”</p>
