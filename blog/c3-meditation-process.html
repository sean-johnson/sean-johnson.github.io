                  <h5>Process over product.</h5>

                  <p>Process helped me alot actually. It made me spend a little more time on practicing my coding skills and less on the aesthetics of the website. I spent more time in sublime than I did designing the web-page. Towards the end however I was finding that I was getting pedantic over smaller and smaller details. Overall, I appreciated the flow of the process and I liked how I had my wireframes to refer back to and keep me focused.

                  <h5>On meditation and "Search Inside Yourself"?</h5>

                  <p>My understanding of meditation has developed over the past 5 years. I used to see meditation as either a religous ritual or as a stress-reliver, depending on what type of meditation was practiced. Now, my understanding of meditation has deepened a lot to the point where I respect it greatly and see it as important aspect to do in my daily life. I also know that there is a lot more to uncover about it.</p>

                  <p>Some new things from reading this book is the science and practical / work ethic benefits that come from practicing meditation. I enjoyed reading as it was using common sense and simplicity when describing it. I enjoyed the parts about attention and meta-attention and the idea that your attention can be trained and strengthened like you can train and strengthen your mind.</p>

                  <p>Observing the mind and using meta-attention stood out to me, I liked the analogy of riding a bicycle, it takes many micro-counter-balances to stay on top. Similarly, meditation requires many micro-observances on the mind to keep it clear and focused. I am currently going through a phase of change and I want to implemplement meditation more extensively into my daily routine.</p>
