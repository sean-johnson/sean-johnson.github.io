                  <h5>When I was stuck on a problem...</h5>

                  <p>All I wanted to do was: When someone pressed the letter 'm' once on the key pad, it would add one table cell to the right of a table row's collection of cells. At the same time, I wanted to give the latest added cell a specific look. If the user was to press the button 'm' again, I wanted the same rules to apply to the next added cell except with a additional instruction of giving the one cell just previously added to change how that looked as well. Trust me, there was more problems on top of that - like; syntax errors, 'grammar' errors or I just didnt know what was possible and I went the long way around to solve the problem! (All good though)</p>

                  <h6>WHAT A MISSION!</h3>

                  <p>I solved the problem with psuedo code first, then googling, then leaving the situation to contemplate while I was doing other work, then googling again. Stack overflow was my friend, people on there helped me out alot. I was late on this, and I made the mistake of not asking my peers and tutors on slack. I was being stubborn as I wanted to solve these problems - and I was typing code away at 2am+ over the last few nights so I wasnt expecting a reply till the next day.</p>

                  <h5>How did I feel with the problem?</h5>             

                  <p>To be honest I felt fixated. I could not get my mind off how to solve each problem I came across. I was actually dreaming code when I fell asleep because I was so fixated. Is that normal?</p>

                  <h5>What did you learn?</h5>             

                  <p>I learned a LOT. I understood more clearly the power of arrays and cycling through loops. I am also understanding the power of functions and asynchronous ... forgot the word ... basically how there is global scope or local scope and how things such as variables are referenced not linearly but hollistically depending on the context.</p>

                  <h5>On problem solving techniques and process.</h5>

                  <p>I learned the most out of sprint 5 during this bootcamp so far. Although I am very new to the process and how to approach programming etc, I am learning so much. I am understanding the depth one has to take in logical thinking in order to comprehend the procedures needed for a computer to carry out a task. I am learning to appreciate elegant code already and am gaining some perspective on when code is dirty (DRY) vs clean and how the same tasks can be instructed in simpler ways. I am also appreciating how a block of code can both be specific but also universal and re-used.</p>

                  <p>I need practice on every element of the process, I feel a little in the dark on whether I am learning the correct habits. I wouldn't mind watching a good programmer go through the whole process of constructing a small web application, and show examples from start to finish on how they would approach things. This would include situations for Psuedocode, Trying something new, Rubber ducky method, Reading error messages, Console.logging, Googling, Asking peers for help etc. For me I felt more confident with Psuedocode and googling. I didn't ask for help from either my peers of coaches but I would actually really like to - it was my own fault as I was coding late at night for this sprint. I want to see my peers face to face and discuss my problems and theirs. My console.logging has been ok; debugging and testing but could improve a lot. I wasn't to good on keeping within my time or meeting deadlines! :(</p>

                  <h5>.map(), .filter(), .reduce()</h5>

                  <p>.map() I think creates a new array of values by calling (or executing) a chosen function for each item in a already defined array? <br>

                  .filter() finds an element/s (or item/s) within an array of a specific description. <br>

                  .reduce() goes and combines defined values in a array from left to right and outputs the end result.

                  </p>
