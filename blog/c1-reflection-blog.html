                  <h5>On Shareef's video;</h5> 

                  <p>I resonated with the 'consumer' or 'creative' student analogy. I appreciated the attention to detail discussed by Shereef on how the subtleties of an student's midset can affect learning outcomes so drastically. Attitudes and outlooks can also have a huge effect on how the student interacts and collaborates with their team and peers.</p>

                  <p>Personally, I enjoy collaboration a lot more than competition. I think a lot more can been achieved using a collaborative environment, where problems can be solved with a positive mindset and where everybody thinks in terms of contributions and offerings. This kind of environment - I think - is a good signal of a team who adopts the 'creative' attitude that Shereef describes.</p>
                  
                  <p>I hope to engage in this kind of culture by being honest and open. I would like to discuss ideas openly and be within an environment where genuine positivity is ambient and learning new ideas / things is the objective.</p>

                  <h5>On EDA's teaching methods;</h5>
                  
                  <p>My EDA expectations have changed. To be quite honest I have become a little more excited because the culture described is something that I resonate with but I didn't know was being practised in a education curriculum (which, to my experience with past study can sometimes be beaurcratic and 'brittle' in the way it operates / moves).</p>
                  
                  <p>I am excited to participate. I am slightly nervous of the fact that I am in Palmerston North and that I would really like to meet up with the rest of the cohort and not miss out on the discussions and fun :( </p>
                  
                  <p>Lastly, I want to learn how to time-box and maybe get to understand the 'pomdoro' technique further. I also am keen to implement what I have learned in design into web development. </p>
