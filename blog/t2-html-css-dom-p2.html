        <h1>T2: Grids and Responsive Design</h1>

        <h2>What is Grid Based Design?</h2>  

        <p>It means dividing the maximum width of the screen size into sections or overarching rows and sub columns so that content can fit into each column. This is useful to help the webdeveloper organise elements into a layout and heirachy (parent section, child elements).
        </p>

        <h2>Responsive Layout?</h2>
        <p>Because screen sizes are many, especially today and probably more so in the future, repsonsive designing of web pages is needed so that a webpage can be viewed from any screen size. Using tags such as media queries in the css stylesheets, can help elements in the HTML document adapt according to screen-viewer.</p>

        <h2>Semantic Structure</h2>
        <p>This is about how the code is organised and read, it can also mean the semantic structure of the designed web-page; which elements catch the eye first, usually moving from left to right etc. In this case however, I think semantic structure uses simplicity and organisation of tags inside the HTML document to describe what content is in the document.</p>

        <h2>Interesting Points?</h2>
        <p>I like the power of css as shown in Udacity's second lesson. Specifically media queries and working with percentages; so that responsive design is possible and simpler to develop.</p>
