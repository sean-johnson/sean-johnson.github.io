                  <h5>Mindfulness and self-awareness.</h5>

                  <p>The relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness is the repetitive action of monitoring who you are, how you feel and identifying what 'is' you and want isn't 'you'.</p>        

                  <h5>Body scanning.</h5>

                  <p>The body scan experiment was quite interesting because it hightlighted the fact that sometimes, its the simple things that we forget about are actually the most beneficial to ourselves. When you are quiet in body and mind, and directed in your attention, your awareness becomes more sensitive to experiences. Similar to what chapter 5 described, clarity and vivid experiences are the results of conducting this experiment. I found that my body parts became 'larger' and more sensitive the further I directed my attention towards it, as I progressed downwards within my body, some areas were harder to move away from - whether it was an indication from my body or because I subconsiously think of those areas more often than the others, my attention was given information from these areas more so than others. Some body parts also gave me emotional thoughts which was also interesing.</p>

                  <p>I think at the end of the day, we spend 99% of our time with our attention directed outwards, and less time within ourselves - whether directed to how we think, feel, how our body feels or reflecting on where our attention is. These experiments remind us of the power in the subtle subjective experience of being aware of ourselves.</p>

                  <h5>My emotions are not me.</h5>

                  <p>To me in a logical way, emotions are attributes derived from the mind and body. Emotions change, come and go, just like our thoughts. What doesn't come and go is the experience of 'I'ness or awareness itself. The awareness of 'I' has always remained present whether experiencing differnt emotions, thoughts, dreams or bodily changes. The 'I'ness of your self has the attributes of awareness and attention; these can only be expanded or reduced in clarity. Emotions condition your thoughts, and your thoughts condition your awareness / direction of attention. Therefore, logically speaking, your emotions <em>cannot</em> be you, they are a part of you just like your hand is a part of your body, or your shoes are a part of your possessions. With constant self-reflection, a person learns the ability to identify with who they really are, while at the same time, being able to detach themselves from their parts that can condition them negatively.</p>

                  <p>It is the <em>association</em> with your emotions that determines its power / influence on your mind and attention. The less you identify with emotions (meaning: the less you think you 'are' your thoughts and emotions), the less it has an effect on your sense of self, subconciousthoughts, activities, reactions, mindsets etc. This can be achieved by understanding who you really are, or, self-reflection.</p>
