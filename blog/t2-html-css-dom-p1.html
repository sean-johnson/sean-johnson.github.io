        <h2>HTML, CSS and DOM</h2>  

        <p>HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage. It is the code that describes and identifies the contents within the page. For example it will identify how many words there will be in the web-page, what images are included, what headings and objects may be included. It identifies each of these elements by using tags at the start and the finish of each element. Think of HTML as the architecture drawings of a house. If the house is already built, think of HTML as being the rooms, the walls, the doors and the roof. 
        </p>
        <p>CSS is the decoration of the elements identified by the HTML code. CSS can move, control sizing, change colour or change nearly anything aesthetic to the appearance of what has been identified in the HTML code. For example, if the HTML Document identifies an image, the CSS code can display the image at a specific size, and perhaps a specific location when veiwing the web page on a web-page browser. </p>
        <p>The DOM, or Document-object-model, from my understanding, is the final output of the code. For example on a google web browser, the DOM is the thing that processes the code written and translates the code to the viewer. The DOM's contents can be viewed via the web tools in google chrome.</p>

        <h2>Boxifying Design?</h2>
        <p>All HTML elements are displayed within square (or rectangle) constraints. Knowing this, when a developer is in the process of translating a web design layout (usually created by a designer) into code, the Web-developer's first steps is to identify which parts of the design will fit into these HTML/CSS element sqaures. Boxifying means the process of identifying and drawing boxes around the design elements on a pre-designed webpage to help identify how many elements will be in the HTML markup, as well as roughly where they will placed and how big they will be in the CSS markup.</p>

        <h2>What is the Box Model?</h2>
        <p>As described above, each HTML element is 'boxed' within square constraints, these constraints also include attributes such as margins, padding, borders, and the contents within the box itself. This structure is refered to as the Box Model.</p>
