                  <h5>Techniques for growing trust and sincerity using empathetic listening.</h5>

                  <p>I tried this experiment for a few minutes with my girlfriend. It really helped. I think everybody enjoys being listened to, I know I do and nine times out of ten I have made a new friend simply by asking them questions, listening to them and relating to what they are interested in and who they are as a person. Also, looking at them in the eyes helps to solidify the connection. It does sound like common sense but I also find it amazing how often people talk <em>at</em> eachother to display their opinions rather than listen and maybe learn something new, while probably gaining trust and happiness in the process. I found myself assuming a person's perspective often and it seems to be increasing as I get older, I seem to care more about my opinion and how I express my identity to others rather than listening to others and learning something new from them. I used to listen with the intent to please others but also learn something new. Now, I witness my mind usually assumes the content that somebody may begin to describe and my mind makes up the rest; I know this hinders me to truly listen to another person and therefore connect with them. <br>
                  This chapter has been great in revitalising and defining simply what I should do when I interact with people, not so that I can inflate my ego, but that It increases my happiness and most likely another person as well. It is a shortcut to having a better day, so why not choose to do it?<br>
                  
                  <h5>Loving kindness meditation.</h5>

                  <p>Trying out meditation with loving and kind thoughts for a person was really helpful in helping me understand that person's similarities to me as well as their qualities from their perspective. Wanting the best in someone else and wishing for their happiness inherently has the consequence of giving the giver a dose of happiness too. This I found very helpful. At first however, I did find it hard to convince my mind to undertake this process as it did seem a little alien and weird at the initial start. My mind would come up with excuses or comments to give doubt to my loving intentions which made me feel un easy about the process. When I let my mind know to be quiet and see it as a simple exercise - My mind began to feel the comments I made for the ones I wish to give kindness to.</p>

                  <h5>Political Awareness Exercise</h5>
                  
                  <p>1. <em>Think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some conflict or disagreement, something real, something that has some meaning and potency for you:</em></p>

                  <p>I have been told that you should never debate about Religion or Politics, so I might as well choose an experience based on both of these. For me, it happened at a house party with other students and many whom I had not met before. At the time, there was a war going on between Israel and Gaza which created a whole discussion on which side was the aggresor and who were the victims etc...</p>

                  <p>2. <em>Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable. Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue:</em></p>

                  <p>I wanted to argue my point from a purely objective point of view, avoiding any connotations relating to religious perspectives of each side. Therefore I tried to use the amount of casualties, and real events that had taken place to justify my angle. I also had actively researched this subject which emotionally pulled me into a general direction on who was the agressor and who were 'defending' themselves based purely on historical events, political movements, military firepower and geographical positions. I also looked at historical events no later than 80 years from the present to justify myself. I also acknowledged how the situation was not black and white and that there were bad and good guys on each side.</p>

                  <p>3. <em>Now describe the situation as though the other person is (or the other people are) 100 percent correct and reasonable. Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue:</em></p>

                  <p>He argued from his religious experience and background, deriving his moral compass from religious teachings. He discussed many ideas on what was promised to which people of each religion and who were the chosen people for that land. He portrayed one side as the aggressors and the other as the victims just defending themselves to the other sides attacks.</p>
