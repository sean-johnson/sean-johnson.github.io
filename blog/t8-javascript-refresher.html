                  <h5>What different 'data-types' are there, and what are they?</h5>

                  <p>First off what is data? Essentially, data is the stored information of sequenced 'bits'. Bits can be sequenced in the form of a 1s and a 0s, or, the shades of black or white, or even as a weak or strong elecrtical charge. The key here is that bits can be any kind of two-valued things. In the case of computers, the sequencing of 1s and 0s is what creates these bits and the combination of these sequences is what 'data' is. Data is informaton.</p>

                  <p>The combination of 1s and 0s can create (probably) an infinite number of data. For example: The combination bit sequence '01000001' is the binary representation in computers for the letter 'a' where as '01001110' is the letter 'n'. To be able to understand and make use of the infinite combination of bits, it is organised in groups. 8bits, 16bits, 32bits and 64bits are all ways that bits are grouped and interpreted to mean something.</p>

                  <p>Data types are the catergorisation of certain types of data. In JavaScript there are data types such as numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, arrays, functions, and undefined values.</p>

                  <p>I like to think that these types are the fundamental building blocks of the javascript language as well as give conceptual rules on how to structure and write the language.</p>

                  <h5>Data structures; Arrays.</h5>

                  <p>An array is a collection of values, grouped within square brackets. Arrays can 'hold' values and these values can be refrenced by calling what numeric index the value is stored in. To access the first value in the array, the number 0 (not 1) is used. for example:</p>

                  <p class="monotype">
                  var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; <br>
                  <br>
                  console.log(cars[0]);<br>

                  // -> "Saab"
                  </p>

                  <h5>What technical gaps in my knowledge did I fill this week?</h5>

                  <p>I had to re-read all chapters from 1-6, and noted down all the terminology that I thought was relevant to my understanding, so that I could continue to comprehend the material as I progressed through the book. I found that I had learned a lot more about Functions, methods, objects, prototypes, constructors, the terminology in general and also conceptual dynamics of how they all interact with eachother.</p>

                  <h5>What are you still feeling unsure about technically?</h5>

                  <p>I feel unsure about how to solve an abstract problem when all of these attributes need to be combined and used together, I still feel insecure about writing the actual code and what bit goes where and when. To overcome this I just need repetition and practice, and that will allow me, I am assuming, to be able to be creative and tackle abstract problems for me in the future. At the moment however, I still feel insecure about tackling such problems by myself.</p>
