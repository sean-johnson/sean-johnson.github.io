                  <h5>Responsive Design.</h5>

                  <p>Responsive design in web development means creating and developing web-page layouts that adapt and change depending on the screen size it is viewed on. It's a very important element to understand as a developer because viewer are not restricted to one screen size; whether they are viewing it on a tablet, their laptop or mobile device, the contents being viewed needs to cater to these various viewing sizes.
                  </p>

                  <h5>What is 'Mobile-first' design?</h5>

                  <p>Mobile first means that you design a website from the viewing perspective of a mobile device, first. Why? Because mobile screens are the smallest, it challenges the designer / developer to really think about the essential elements that should be on the web page, it helps to identify in the simplist format what is most important. When this is defined, then you can about adding extra features or links in the larger screen formats. Mobile first helps to keep you focused on the objective.
                  </p>

                  <h5>What are frameworks?</h5>

                  <p>Frameworks exist to make a developers job easier. Essentially, frameworks are pre-written code that act as a 'base' when starting a project. Usually CSS frameworks such as 'bootstrap' or 'skeleton' are a collection of css tags that help the developer with things such as layout and grid structure, typography, colours, button aesthetics, it has a good basic ground work so that you can spend more time on coding and less time on specific aesthetic details etc.    
                  </p>

                  <p>Frameworks complexity ranges and that can give both advantages and disadvantages when coding or designing a site. Some advantages of frameworks is that it gives you a clean template and usually 'clean' code. Frameworks can also save you alot of time without having to do the 'basic' code everytime you start a project. Disadvantages however, is that aesthetically, some frameworks (which are popular) can create work that is mundane and uncreative. For example, one can learn to see website that have been developed in certain frameworks; Bootstrap is a good example, where the layout and style of bootstrap is noticable which can make the site seem un-original.

                  <h5>Wireframes.</h5>

                  <p>Wireframes are basically draft copies of what you want your site to look like. It gives a breif overview of elements and sections on the page (usually blocked out by squares). Its used as a rough template to structure your website when you develop it in code.   
                  </p>

                <div class="row">              
                  <div class="blog-content-img">                  
                    <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.png" alt="">
                  </div>            
                </div>

                  <h5>Implementing my wireframe.</h5>

                  <p>I had fun implementing my wireframe. It was a simple design and I wanted it to be simple, but I wanted the navigation and functionality to be fluid and fun. I found it hard to implement some elements however. These were usually layout and responsive elements. Divs,divs,divs. I found it hard to 'stick' some elements to the floor of the screen and add margins. I also found it hard to understand the interactions with the 'display' and 'position' properties in my css code. I did manage to get my footer to being fixed on the floor, while my content of the page could go underneath and scroll etc. That was a mish.
