                  <h5>Search Inside Yourself: Chapter 3.</h5>

                  <p>The mindfulness conversation between my partner and I was quite interesting. I understand that from reading this book, it all depends on how much you truly value its contents, because you are dealing with the chatter of your mind <em>as the subject</em> which makes the findings and experiments very personal and close to your thoughts. I found that if a paragraph did not resonate with me, it was hard to value it in my mind. But for learnings sake I gave the conversation method a go. Funnily enough, I became aware of my impulsiveness to want to talk and express my opinion rather than learning or listening to partner at first, but after this realisation, I wanted to truly listen.</p>

                  <p>I remember a First Nation quote which says: "While the tounge moves, the ears cannnot listen.  Wisdom comes only in silence." I found this quite appropiate to my understanding of being mindful in conversation.</p> 
                  <p>To go further however, I would even say that if the Mind is moving in thoughts, the attention cannot listen. It is similar to how we talk to one another quite frequently, we talk <em>at</em> eachother rather than talk to learn or listen.</p>                  

                  <h5>How to sustain my practice in mindfulness.</h5>

                  <p>I understand the reasons to be aware of your breath, I think. Your breath resides only in the here and now and it is a neutral experience. Therefore, breath helps your attention to be grounded in the now —to be aware of the present, rather than be pulled by the mind into regrets or fears about what has happened in the past or what may happen in the future. You also are always breathing until you die so it always there with you to remind you. I understand that being mindful of breath is a tecnique similar to a mantra or repition of certain words; its job is to keep the mind on a specific task rather than giving it the oppurtunity to become scattered.</p>

                  <p>For me, I will try to be more mindful while walking and talking to others. I also want to keep meditating everyday in a morning sitting. I liked the idea that of the focused and open attention method where you take intervals to focus and then let experiences come to you. I feel these are excersising the two qualities of your attention. So, to strengthen my awareness of these, I wish to practice these.</p>

                  <h5>Last comments.</h5>

                  <p>At the end of the day, I feel it's all about your attention. Whether you play guitar as a form of meditation, learning code, cooking, or sitting and closing your eyes, The universal quality in all of them has to do with where you put your attention. My friend always says: "Wherever your attention goes, the energy flows". Putting your attention on your attention - how it works, how it is influenced, is to me, my definition of meditation.</p>
