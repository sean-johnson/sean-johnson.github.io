                  <h5>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>

                  <p>I want to use the analogy of building a house (stolen from Udacity) to explain each job of HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML is the markup language used to identify and define what element are on a web-page, in terms of building a house, it'l be the walls and rooms, and where they are situated in context to eachother. CSS is the decoration, meaning the colour of the curtains and choice of furniture, its job is to make the house (or web page) look aesthetically pleasing. Within a room (or div) the colour pallette may change, the style of the furniture may change.</p>

                  <p>For Javascript - in terms of coding - it allows the user to interact with a web-page; click this button and it does something like give you a pop up message. This is acheived with javascript. A lot can also be achieved by javascript as opposed to HTML and CSS which have limited responsibilities. In terms of a house, Javascript would be like the electric wiring throughout the house. If a person was to click a light switch in a certain room, it would be the electricity and the wiring that will turn the lights on as a result. The same goes for javascript in web development.</p>

                  <p>Javascript will 'listen' for an action done by the user (like clicking a red button) and when javascript sees that the user has done such an action, it goes about giving a instruction or result of somekind. It could be that the button gives you a pop up message to answer a question, or it makes a sound, or it changes the button's colour. Javascript's job is about functions and interactions with the user.</p>             

                  <h5>Control Flow.</h5>

                  <p>From what I understand, control flow is the grammar structure needed for javascript to interpret instructions. Fundamentally, it requires a 'boolean' or a true or false oppurtunity to answer, in order to progress through the code. 'If / else statements' are really just booleans, asking whether something is true or false. If something is true then do this instruction (if statement). Otherwise, if it is false; do this instruction (else statement).</p>

                  <p>For example; Am I tired at the moment? if the answer is 'yes' or 'true' then I should probably go to sleep for 8 hours to no longer be tired. Otherwise (else) if I am not tired at the time of me asking this question, then I should go and play some sports. Simply put, depending on my position will determine a specific outcome as a result. I am realising ALOT can happen from just the result of true or false - or - 1s and 0s.</p>

                  <h5>Arrays and object literals.</h5>

                  <p>An Array's elements within [] are indexed in a linear fashion from 0-whatever. An object's literal elements are boxed within brackets {}. From what I understand an array is numerically accessed and indexed, where as a object literal is not and can be referenced or accessed regardless of the positioning of that element within the object's brackets.</p>

                  <h5>Functions.</h5>

                  <p>Functions are basically a series of instructions made up of operators and datatypes encapsulated into one unit to carry out a particular task when called upon. A function is usually given a custom name and defined as a function so that javascript can interpret it's purpose properly. It then goes about explaining what it's instructions are which is explained within its own curly brackets {}. This block of code or function can be seen as one entity made up of many instructions. This entity or function is therefore is given a name such as 'functionWhatever()' so that it can be referred to in the future. The function can be called upon and executed, and used in other areas of your code.</p> 

                  <p>Its useful because one function can be called upon executed multiple time for different situations. For example: you may create a function called 'divideByFive()' whose instructions are to divide something by 5, 'something' being any number, yet to be defined. If in the future I had the number 25 and I wished to divide this by 5, I could call upon that function to carry out the task. I would call 'divideByFive(25)', and it would go about dividing 25 by 5 as I had included my defined number in the () brackets.</p>
