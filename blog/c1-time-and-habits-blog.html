                  <h5>My thoughts on Meditation.</h5>

                  <p>Again, I was surprised by the mention of meditation for this bootcamp. I have been interested in, and practicing meditation for the past 5 years and I was really happy to see information about the external and productive benefits that meditation can bring.</p>
                  <p>What I found interesting about meditation and the concept of FLOW, is that each resemble a principle of having one-pointed attention, and that being 'happily focused' in a observational mindset can actually be 10x more productive in a person's efforts when working.</p>
                  <p>Meditation can be helpful to a person's mind by strengthing their power of attention like it is a muscle, avoiding situations where the mind can become scattered, where constantly having multiple strains of thought can lead to a 'mind-cloud' and eventually stress and anxiety.</p>
                  <p>To be honest I used to meditate every day, for 2 1/2 hours, but that reduced to 1 hour last year, then 30mins in the recent past. The last two weeks I haven't meditated at all. I think it was due to me having a lot of free time, where my mind wants to do so many things and loses the overall value of what meditation can bring to the quality of your life and awareness.</p>
                  <p>I guess I started seeing meditation as a chore rather than as a benefit lately but I know that it would always be within my life. Reading these blog posts about meditation, productivity and habits has made me appreciate meditation once again so I think I am getting back on that horse!.</p> 

                  <h5>My thoughts on Flow and Habits.</h5>

                  <p>I read the blog posts about flow and small habits. Again serendipitously, and not too long ago, I had read FLOW by Mihály Csíkszentmihályia, which I fell upon by reading another book called Bold by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHCsV0VzrqQ" title="">Steven Kotler</a> whose enterprenural lifestyle is focused on engineering better people through habit forming and self-reflection. Another book that touched on willpower and power of incremental habit forming through small achievable steps was called <a href="http://minihabits.com/" title="">Mini Habits</a> by Stephen Guise. I enjoyed it from the perspective that you start small, so that your standards are low and are achievable and that you are not eating into your limited resource called willpower. I think the adoption of both techniques is a great arsenal to have in being a productive person. I want to try these techniques out for this bootcamp and see how I go... </p>

                  <p>1. Meditate everyday for 30mins.</p>
                  <p>2. Identify 1 small Habit that I would like to implement everyday (e.g do a stretch for every hour at desk for 5mins, or drink more water - I'll see which one I shouldfocus on first) </p>
