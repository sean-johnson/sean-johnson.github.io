                  <h5>What were your goals for the week?</h5>

                  <p>I had three goals centred around me practicing my knowledge on javascript and using functions that allow the user to simply interact with the website. I wanted to create something that was both aesthetically pleasing but also something that was achievable on my own. In order to spend more time on javascript and less time on creating new material using HTML and CSS I decided to expand on my blog-website.</p> 

                  <p>My objectives were:</p>

                  <ul>
	                  <li>To change the background of my home-page, contact, blog-menu and portfolio page and add a subtle gradient that would change tone, reacting to the user's mouse movements.</li> 
	                  <li>Add a portfolio menu that actually had content and thumbnails of projects that I had completed so far. I also wanted to reveal further information using javascript when the user either highlighted the project or clicked on the thumbnail of it. </li>
	                  <li>Lastly, I wanted to clean up any of the code that I felt could be simplified once I had finished the first two objectives. I envisioned this because I assumed I would know more by the end of the tasks and therefore be in a better mindset to reduce my code succinctly. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5> Did you accomplish them? If not, why? and did you attempt your stretch goal, if so, how did it go?</h5>

                  <p>I didn't complete all of them. I got my gradient function working on firefox and chrome. I know that If I was to approach an adept developer, they would probably say: "Why didn't you just do it like this?" and I would laugh and wonder why I spent so many hours down the rabbit hole. However! at the time I was coding consistently for hours in which case I was learning a lot. So for that reason, I am happy. I would like to get the rest of the portfolio page sorted, I will carry on and do this before I progress. I didn't get my stretch goal done...</p>

                  <h5>What technical gaps in your knowledge did you fill this week?</h5>

                  <p>I learned a lot about compatibilty issues and manipulating CSS using javascript. I spent a lot of time coming across bug issues depending on which browser I viewed my gradient from and thought hard about how I could simplify my code while making it work on most browsers. I also learned a lot about how to interpret mouse x and y movement positions and then using those positions to translate into RGB codes. That was fun and I felt happy when I got what I wanted. </p>

                  <h5>Are you happy with what you got done?</h5>

                  <p>I am happy with the result and happy with my process. I know that my personal project could be interpreted as quite simple, however I did this to re-enforce my own understanding. I enjoyed repetitively writing new code so that I could be more confident in solving unique problems. Iam not at place where I want to be, however I can see that I have grown as a developer in comparison to last week.</p>
