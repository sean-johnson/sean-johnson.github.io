                  <h5>Reflections on Searching Inside Yourself;</h5>

                  <p>Google noted that productivity prospered more hollistically from the activities of how people interacted with each other. In most cases, the ability for teams to work as a whole was a greater asset to productivity and was valued more so than the level of an individual's technical talents. Emotional intelligence is about understanding the dynamics of ourselves, how we feel, how we think and lastly how we interact with those around us. Apart from technical knowledge such as learning code, another form of knowledge comes from the subjectivity of how you view yourself and those you interact with. It is the ability to understand, monitors use the power of emotional intelligence can help with social interactions, help with they understanding one's own and other's emotions (empathy), as well as thoughts and motivations.  The book listed 5 key values in understanding Emotional Intellegence;
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Self-Awareness</li>
                    <li>Self-Regulation</li>
                    <li>Motivation</li>
                    <li>Empathy</li>
                    <li>Social Skills</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>Mutliple forms of Intelligence?</h5>
                  <p>IQ isn't the only form of intelligence. EQ or emotional intelligence is also very valuable, especially in a time like ours where society is ultra connected. The ability to have empathy, understand others and also being able understand your place in it, are all key qualities that EQ helps to identify and develop.</p>

                  <h5>Mindfulness</h5>
                  <p>I meditated for 10mins, my mind just became louder in the process. It was like putting a pet in a cage; it got anxious and wanted to get out. Better luck next time for me I guess, I have to keep repeating the practice.</p>
