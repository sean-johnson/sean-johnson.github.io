                  <h5>Making friends with your emotions.</h5>

                  <p>This chapter which discussed how to deal with you emotions opened up a lot about myself and how I view myself as a person. First off, When carrying out the exercise on reflecting on a negative memory, I found it very difficult to replace it with kindness and logical steps to overcome. I realised I am a 'grasper' when it comes to dealing with these kinds of situations; I become fixated on the problem and usually do experience a 'feeling bad about feeling bad' mentality. I also play stories in my head to further intensify the imaginary problem, usually resulting in me becoming angry at something or someone —which I know is silly. Honestly, at the time I carried out these excercies I experienced my logic becoming clouded and it was hard to focus my attention on the intended task, I felt 'good' in a paradoxical way when I intensified the bad experience. This was also a realisation on seeing my 'monsters' first hand.</p>

                  <p>Reflecting on this has helped me understand myself better, actually it's helped me understand my many selves better. Further, it's helped me put names to the faces and give definitions on what I usually do when these events arise. There are very few that can set me off, but I know that these few circumstances can really set me off into someone I don't know and dont want to be. The steps to stop, breathe, understand and respond are a great technique to give time and reflection in these kinds of situations. I will try these techniques next time at my best ability.</p>
